main.txt is a main branch
develop is branch from main
hotflix is a another branch from main
hotflix2(hotflix2.txt) is another brach from main
ipl2025(futurebranch.txt) is branch from develop
.

first step i pulled the ipl2025 to develop, 
next step i pulled the hotflix2 to main, 
after main branch pull to develop while pulling the two branch i  get a conflict because of same file , so i created a stash changes for one brach after that i pulled the another branch then now unstash changes while unstash changes it shows merge so you have merge that branches. 
develop pr(pull request) to main and this is my final step.
